It is time-aware and rewards posts that are published in or near a burst of posts that are ranked highly in many of the lists being aggregated. Our experimental results show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rank aggregation and time-sensitive microblog search algorithms.</p> <p>[bibtex key=CIKM:2014:Liang]</p> </body></html>
