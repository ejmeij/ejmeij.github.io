The system is applied to online conference talks. In particular, we adapt <a href="http://edgar.meij.pro/feeding-screen-semantic-linking-based-subtitles/" title="Feeding the Second Screen: Semantic Linking based on Subtitles" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a recently proposed semantic linking approach for streams of television broadcasts</a> to facilitate generating contextual links while a TED talk is being viewed. <a href="http://www.ted.com/" title="TED" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TED</a> is a highly popular global conference series covering many research domains; the publicly available talks have accumulated a total view count of over one billion at the time of writing. We exploit the multi-linguality of Wikipedia and the TED subtitles to provide contextual suggestions in the language of the user watching a video. In this way, a vast source of educational and intellectual content is disclosed to a broad audience that might otherwise experience difficulties interpreting it.</p> <p>[bibtex key=WOLE:2013:Odijk]</p> </body></html>
