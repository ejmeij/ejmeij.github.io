We hypothesized that applying query expansion techniques would help us both to identify and retrieve synonymous terms, and to cope with ambiguity. To this end, we developed several collection-specific as well as web-based strategies. We also performed post-submission experiments, in which we compare various retrieval engines, such as Lucene, Indri, and Lemur, using a simple baseline topic set. When indexing entire paragraphs as pseudo-documents, we find that Lemur is able to achieve the highest document-, passage-, and aspect-level scores, using the KL-divergence method and its default settings. Additionally, we index the collection at a lower level of granularity, by creating pseudo-documents comprising of individual sentences. When we search these instead of paragraphs in Lucene, the passage-level scores improve considerably. Finally we note that stemming improves overall scores by at least 10%.</p> <p>[bibtex key=TREC:2006:meij]</p> </body></html>
