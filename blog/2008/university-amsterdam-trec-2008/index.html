Our main preliminary conclusions are that estimating mixture weights for external expansion in blog post retrieval is non-trivial and we need more analysis to find out why it works better for blog distillation than for blog post retrieval. For the relevance feedback track we observe two things: (i) in terms of statMAP, a larger number of judged non-relevant documents improves retrieval effectiveness and (ii) on the TREC Terabyte topics, we can effectively replace the estimates on the judged non-relevant documents with estimations on the document collection. Finally, since the enterprise track did not have any results yet, we only described our participation and do not draw any conclusions.</p> <p>[bibtex key=TREC-WN:2008:balog]</p> <p>http://www.slideshare.net/edgar.meij/query-modeling-using-nonrelevance-information-trec-2008-relevance-feedback-track-talk-edgar-meij-univ-of-amsterdam-presentation</p> </body></html>
