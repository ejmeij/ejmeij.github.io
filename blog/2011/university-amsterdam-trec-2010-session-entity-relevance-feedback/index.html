In the Session Track we explore the use of blind relevance feedback to bias a follow-up query towards or against the topics covered in documents returned to the user in response to the original query. In the Entity Track REF task we experiment with a window size parameter to limit the amount of context considered by the entity co-occurrence models and explore the use of Freebase for type filtering, entity normalization and homepage finding. In the ELC task we use an approach that uses the number of links shared between candidate and example entities to rank candidates. In the Relevance Feedback Track we experiment with a novel model that uses Wikipedia to expand the query language model.</p> <p>[bibtex key=TREC:2011:bron]</p> </body></html>
