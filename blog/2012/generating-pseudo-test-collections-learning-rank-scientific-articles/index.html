We propose a method for generating pseudo test collections in the domain of digital libraries, where data is relatively sparse, but comes with rich annotations. Our intuition is that documents are annotated to make them better findable for certain information needs. We use these annotations and the associated documents as a source for pairs of queries and relevant documents. We investigate how learning to rank performance varies when we use different methods for sampling annotations, and show how our pseudo test collection ranks systems compared to editorial topics with editorial judgements. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to train a learning to rank algorithm on generated pseudo judgments. In some cases, performance is on par with learning on manually obtained ground truth.</p> <p>[bibtex key=CLEF:2012:berendsen]</p> </body></html>
