The structured nature of the data in KGs is typically not suitable to show to an end user and applications that utilize KGs therefore benefit from human-readable textual descriptions of KG relationships. We present a method that automatically generates textual descriptions of entity relationships by combining textual and KG information. Our method creates sentence templates for a particular relationship and then generates a textual description of a relationship instance by selecting the best template and filling it with appropriate entities. Experimental results show that a supervised variation of our method outperforms other variations as it captures the semantic similarity between a relationship instance and a template best, whilst providing more contextual information.</p> <p>[bibtex key=ECIR:2017:voskarides]</p> </body></html>
