The increasing depth and breadth of content in KGs makes them not only rich sources of structured knowledge by themselves but also valuable resources for search systems. A surge of recent developments in entity linking and retrieval methods gave rise to a new line of research that aims at utilizing KGs for text-centric retrieval applications, making this an ideal time to pause and report current findings to the community, summarizing successful approaches, and soliciting new ideas. This tutorial is the first to disseminate the progress in this emerging field to researchers and practitioners.</p> </body></html>
