The KG-BIAS 2020 workshop touches on biases and how they surface in knowledge graphs (KGs), biases in the source data that is used to create KGs, methods for measuring or remediating bias in KGs, but also identifying other biases such as how and which languages are represented in automatically constructed KGs or how personal KGs might incur inherent biases. The goal of this workshop is to uncover how various types of biases are introduced into KGs, investigate how to measure, and propose methods to remediate them. \[bibtex key=AKBC:2020:Meij\]
