We describe the participation of the University of Amsterdamâ€™s ILPS group in the relevance feedback track at TREC 2008. We introduce a new model which incorporates information from relevant and non-relevant documents to improve the estimation of query models. Our main findings are twofold: (i) in terms of statMAP, a larger number of judged non-relevant documents improves retrieval effectiveness and (ii) on the TREC Ter- abyte topics, we can effectively replace the estimates on the judged non-relevant documents with estimations on the document collection.
