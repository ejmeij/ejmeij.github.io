The camera-ready ver­sion of the ECIR papers, [A Framework for Unsupervised Spam Detection in Social Networking Sites](http://edgar.meij.pro/framework-unsupervised-spam-detection-social-networking-sites/ "A Framework for Unsupervised Spam Detection in Social Networking Sites") (with Maarten Bosma and Wouter Weerkamp) and [Adaptive Temporal Query Modeling](http://edgar.meij.pro/adaptive-temporal-query-modeling/ "Adaptive Temporal Query Modeling") (with Hendrike Peetz, Wouter Weerkamp, and [Maarten de Rijke](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~mdr/ "Maarten de Rijke's homepage")) are available now.

In the first paper, we report on the effectiveness of an unsupervised spam detection method for community-based websites, where users can indicate whether messages posted by others are spam. The collection of the user-generated messages that we used, their spam reports, and labels will be released soon, stay tuned.
