We describe the participation of the University of Amsterdamâ€™s Intelligent Systems Lab in the relevance feedback track at TREC 2009. Our main conclusion for the relevance feedback track is that a topical diversity approach provides good feedback documents. Further, we find that our relevance feedback algorithm seems to help most when there are sufficient relevant documents available.
