I'm happy to announce that we have just opened up our applications for next year's internships at Yahoo Labs in Barcelona. So, if you're a PhD student in a related field, do consider applying. Especially if you're interested in spending some time in sunny Barcelona and gaining research experience along the way, you're more than welcome.

The application form can be found at http://comunicacio.barcelonamedia.org/yahoo/, the deadline is January 13th, 2014.

Do reach out if you have any questions!
