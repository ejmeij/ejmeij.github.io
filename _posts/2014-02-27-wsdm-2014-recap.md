WSDM is wrapping up today, with only the workshops left for tomorrow. All in all, it was an exciting WSDM with lots of interesting talks and discussions. And of course Times Square cannot be beaten as conference venue location. Some papers/talks that caught my (semantic search) eye at WSDM, in no particular order.
