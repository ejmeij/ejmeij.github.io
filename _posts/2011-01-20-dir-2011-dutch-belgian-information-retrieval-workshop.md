DIR 2011, the 11th Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop, was organized by the Information and Language Processing group (ILPS) of the University of Amsterdam in collaboration with the Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI). Two types of submissions were accepted for the workshop: research papers describing original research, compressed contributions presenting a sum- mary of previously published work, and demonstrations.

There were many people who helped organize DIR 2011, making it a success. We would like to thank them all. In particular, we are gratefull to our keynote speakers, Nick Belkin (Rutgers University) and Gabriella Kazai (Microsoft Research).
