![Horizon 2020](images/horizon2020.jpg "Horizon 2020")

These are my notes from the "Getting ready for Horizon 2020" workshop, presented by Dr. Seán McCarthy from Hyperion Ltd at CWI on Oct 1 2012.<!--more-->

- Website associated with the workshop, for more information: [http://www.hyperion.ie/horizon2020.htm](http://www.hyperion.ie/horizon2020.htm "http://www.hyperion.ie/horizon2020.htm")
- There's a 'Horizon 2020' group on LinkedIn
- Use [http://europa.eu](http://europa.eu "http://europa.eu") to follow ongoing debates on a certain topic (use Google and a conjunctive query)
- First part on the politics, made for 'directors' – the big picture
- Very few people aware of FP7, so first a zoom-in on these projects
    - A little history (from 2000 onwards)...
    - Horizon 2020 is not called FP-8, because it's a mixture of programs, with strong links to other programs
- '"Innovation" will be the "new agriculture" for the next 15 years'
- H2020
- Europe 2020 Strategy: 7 flagship initiatives
    - Digital agenda for Europe
    - Innovation Union
    - Youth on the move
    - An agenda for new skills and jobs
    - Resource efficient Europe
    - Europe against poverty
    - An industrial policy for the globalisation era
- Horizon 2020 is like taking the FP-7 LEGO blocks and reassembling them
- Separate programs
    - "Innovation in SMEs" programme – valorisation
        - Bring technologies to the market
        - USA's SBIR (~ "STW Valorisation")
    - KETs (Key Enabling Technologies), since 2009 already.
        - [http://www.hyperion.ie/ket.htm](http://www.hyperion.ie/ket.htm "http://www.hyperion.ie/ket.htm")
        - 6.7b EUR
    - FET
        - "an idea that might work or not, doesn't matter if it doesn't"
        - e.g., wearable electronics (influence of music on physiology), nature as computing
    - EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) = European MIT
        - Not really a programme, but it has relevant options
- Funding typically only for "Phase 1," i.e., pre-competitive ideas/activities.
    - "Funding the checking of the patent, not the filing." Examples of pre-competitive
    - Examples
        - ERC
        - FET
        - Industrial Leadership Societal Challenges
        - Eureka (actually between pre-competitive and competitive)
            - technology transfer
    - competitive
        - EIT
        - EIP (competitive)
            - Bv. "Smart cities"
- H2020
    - has money for VCs, covering the whole value chain
    - Budget (numbers are still changing)
        - ~ 87.7b EUR
        - EIT interesting, see the notes and below
    - Exercise: for each institute: walk through the documents and identify which programmes etc. are relevant
    - Trends
        - FP5-FP6-FP7-H2020: projects -> programmes
- Part II: FET
    - little topic in FP-7
    - Now: 3.5b EUR
    - radical innovations
    - FET Open
        - "what you submit is submitted (no resubmissions)" Although they are pre-proposals
    - FET Proactive
    - FET Flagships (FuturICT, e.g.)
        - two are selected: those will receive EUR 100m per year for 10 years. (But this will need to come from local governments.)
    - FET Young Explorers
    - SME
- EIT
    - part of DG education
    - 2007-2013 (309m EUR)
    - 2014-2020 (3.2b EUR)
    - proposed (H2020): transfer/valorisation
    - Research -> industry
    - 3 KICs (knowledge and innovation communities)
    - research centres + universities + education (local! regional...)
    - 1 of them is "EIT ICT Labs"
        - 2/3 of European R&D spending in ICT
        - e.g., Eindhoven: Philips + Twente + Novay + TNO-ICT.
    - another is EIT Climate KIC
        - e.g., Randstad
    - H2020: 3 new ones (so 3.2b EUR)
        - Added-value manufacturing (Key Enabling Tech)
        - Smart secure societies
        - Urban mobility
- "Joint programming"
    - Local money, no EC involvement although they want to
- ERA-Net, ERA-Net Plus
    - EU + national funding
    - next ones
        - urban Europe
        - climate change
        - microbial challenge
        - aging
        - water challenges
        - seas and oceans
- Public procurement
    - small companies can bid for small parts of projects (public tender)
- EIP (European Innovation Partnerships)
    - related to the EU 2020 flagships (see above)
- Part IV – changes in H2020 from FP7
    - overhead
        - FP7: actual overhead
        - H2020 (proposed): 20% of eligible costs
    - funding
        - FP7: 75% research, 50% demonstration, 100 mgmt
        - H2020 (proposed): 100% research, 75% innovation
        - impacts mainly SMEs, companies
    - productive hours (H2020) 1680 hours per annum)
    - decision expected before the end of the year
    - evaluation criteria
        - old
            - science
            - implementation
            - impact
        - new
            - excellence
            - impact
            - implementation
        - Open access, no time sheets
- Part V – Lobbying
    - Top-down (from EU) vs bottom-up (from researchers) lobbying. How? Through ERC, research infrastructure, etc.
    - "Lobbying," i.e. the EU asks for comments on the drafts of the programme from EU researchers
    - Make sure your topic is in the call (draft first and final also of course)
    - Decision-making process…
- Part X – Getting ready for H2020
    - Getting ready for H2020
        - Different strategies, see the notes
- Last part
