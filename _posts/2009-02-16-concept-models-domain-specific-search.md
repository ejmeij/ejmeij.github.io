We describe our participation in the 2008 CLEF Domain-specific track. We evaluate blind relevance feedback models and concept models on the CLEF domain-specific test collection. Applying relevance modeling techniques is found to have a positive effect on the 2008 topic set, in terms of mean average precision and precision@10. Applying concept models for blind relevance feedback, results in even bigger improvements over a query-likelihood baseline, in terms of mean average precision and early precision.
