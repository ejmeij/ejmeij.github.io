		Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting and has the potential to upend entire business models and structures. The adoption of such new technologies to support newsgathering processes is established practice for newsrooms. For AI specifically, we are seeing a new era of AI-assisted journalism emerge with trust in the AI-driven analyses and accuracy of results as core tenets.

		In Part I of this position paper, we discuss the contributions of six recently published research papers co-authored by Bloomberg's Artificial Intelligence Engineering team that show the intricacies of training AI models for reliable newsgathering processes. The papers investigate (a) the creation of models for updated headline generation, showing that headline generation models benefit from access to the past state of the article, (b) sequentially controlled text generation, which is a novel task and we show that in general, more structured awareness results in higher control accuracy and grammatical coherence, (c) chart summarization, which looks into identifying the key message and generating sentences that describe salient information in the multimodal documents, (d) a semistructured natural language inference task to develop a framework for data augmentation for tabular inference, (e) the introduction of a human-annotated dataset (ENTSUM) for controllable summarization with a focus on named entities as the aspect to control, and (f) a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks (ATINTER). We also examine Bloomberg's research work, building its own internal, not-for-commercial-use large language model, BloombergGPT, and training it with the goal of demonstrating support for a wide range of tasks within the financial industry.

		In Part II, we analyze the evolution of automation tasks in the Bloomberg newsroom that led to the creation of Bloomberg's News Innovation Lab. Technology-assisted content creation has been a reality at Bloomberg News for nearly a decade and has evolved from rules-based headline generation from structured files to the constant exploration of potential ways to assist story creation and storytelling in the financial domain. The Lab now oversees the operation of hundreds of software bots that create semi- and fully automated stories of financial relevance, providing journalists with depth in terms of data and analysis, speed in terms of reacting to breaking news, and transparency to corners of the financial world where data investigation is a gigantic undertaking. The Lab recently introduced new tools that provide journalists with the ability to explore automation on demand while it continues to experiment with ways to assist story production.

		In Part III, we conceptually discuss the transformative impact that generative AI can have in any newsroom, along with considerations about the technology's shortcomings in its current state of development. As with any revolutionary new technology, as well as with exciting research opportunities, part of the challenge is balancing any potential positive and negative impacts on society. We offer our principles and guidelines used to inform our approach to experimenting with the new generative AI technologies. Bloomberg News' style guide reminds us that our ``journalism is aimed at possibly the most sophisticated audience in the world, for whom accuracy is essential.''

		This tutorial will provide an overview of recent advances on neuro-symbolic approaches for information retrieval. A decade ago, knowledge graphs and semantic annotations technology led to active research on how to best leverage symbolic knowledge. At the same time, neural methods have demonstrated to be versatile and highly effective.

		From a neural network perspective, the same representation approach can service document ranking or knowledge graph reasoning. End-to-end training allows to optimize complex methods for downstream tasks.

		We are at the point where both the symbolic and the neural research advances are coalescing into neuro-symbolic approaches. The underlying research questions are how to best combine symbolic and neural approaches, what kind of symbolic/neural approaches are most suitable for which use case, and how to best integrate both ideas to advance the state of the art in information retrieval.

Modern IR systems can benefit from information available in KGs in multiple ways, independent of whether the KGs are publicly available or proprietary ones. We provide an overview of the components required when building IR systems that leverage KGs and use a task-oriented organization of the material that we discuss. As an understanding of the intersection of IR and KGs is beneficial to many researchers and practitioners, we consider prior work from two complementary angles: leveraging KGs for information retrieval and enriching KGs using IR techniques. We start by discussing how KGs can be employed to support IR tasks, including document and entity retrieval. We then proceed by describing how IR--and language technology in general--can be utilized for the construction and completion of KGs. This includes tasks such as entity recognition, typing, and relation extraction. We discuss common issues that appear across the tasks that we consider and identify future directions for addressing them. We also provide pointers to datasets and other resources that should be useful for both newcomers and experienced researchers in the area.},

One critical component that is required in such systems is a method to automatically determine how notable a certain news story is, in order to prioritize these stories during delivery. One way to do so is to compare each story in a stream of news stories to a notable event. In other words, the problem of detecting notable news can be defined as a ranking task; given a trusted source of notable events and a stream of candidate news stories, we aim to answer the question: ``Which of the candidate news stories is most similar to the notable one?''. We employ different combinations of features and learning to rank (LTR) models and gather relevance labels using crowdsourcing. In our approach, we use structured representations of candidate news stories (triples) and we link them to corresponding entities. Our evaluation shows that the features in our proposed method outperform standard ranking methods, and that the trained model generalizes well to unseen news stories.},

New analysis tools and publicly accessible utterances, opinions, transactions and interactions resulting from widespread internet and social media usage facilitate new, data-intensive research methods in disciplines that have so far relied on small-scale literature and/or panel-based studies. To illustrate the new possibilities, we report on a pilot carried out by a cross-disciplinary team consisting of computer scientists and researchers in religious studies. In the latter area, research is often focused on mapping out the convictions, hopes, and beliefs of groups of people, be it within certain religions or within any other group, such as those defined by a political party. In the pilot, religious scholars examined the core keywords in a left-wing political party in order to determine their hopes and beliefs.

We propose and compare various methods for addressing this task, using a mixture of information retrieval and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we present a supervised machine learning-based method to determine which concepts are intended by a user issuing a query. The concepts are obtained from an ontology and may be used to provide contextual information, related concepts, or navigational suggestions to the user submitting the query. Our approach first ranks candidate concepts using a language modeling for information retrieval framework. We then extract query, concept, and search-history feature vectors for these concepts. Using manual annotations we inform a machine learning algorithm that learns how to select concepts from the candidates given an input query. Simply performing a lexical match between the queries and concepts is found to perform poorly and so does using retrieval alone, i.e., omitting the concept selection stage. Our proposed method significantly improves upon these baselines and we find that support vector machines are able to achieve the best performance out of the machine learning algorithms evaluated.},

	abstract     = {Result diversification is a retrieval strategy for dealing with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries by providing documents that cover as many facets of the query as possible. We propose a result diversification framework based on query-specific clustering and cluster ranking, in which diversification is restricted to documents belonging to clusters that potentially contain a high percentage of relevant documents. Empirical results show that the proposed framework improves the performance of several existing diversification methods. The framework also gives rise to a simple yet effective cluster-based approach to result diversification that selects documents from different clusters to be included in a ranked list in a round robin fashion. We describe a set of experiments aimed at thoroughly analyzing the behavior of the two main components of the proposed diversification framework, ranking and selecting clusters for diversification. Both components have a crucial impact on the overall performance of our framework, but ranking clusters plays a more important role than selecting clusters. We also examine properties that clusters should have in order for our diversification framework to be effective. Most relevant documents should be contained in a small number of high-quality clusters, while there should be no dominantly large clusters. Also, documents from these high-quality clusters should have a diverse content. These properties are strongly correlated with the overall performance of the proposed diversification framework.},

An important application of semantic web technology is recognizing human-defined concepts in text. Query transformation is a strategy often used in search engines to derive queries that are able to return more useful search results than the original query and most popular search engines provide facilities that let users complete, specify, or reformulate their queries. We study the problem of semantic query suggestion, a special type of query transformation based on identifying semantic concepts contained in user queries. We use a feature-based approach in conjunction with supervised machine learning, augmenting term-based features with search history-based and concept-specific features. We apply our method to the task of linking queries from real-world query logs (the transaction logs of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision) to the DBpedia knowledge base. We evaluate the utility of different machine learning algorithms, features, and feature types in identifying semantic concepts using a manually developed test bed and show significant improvements over an already high baseline. The resources developed for this paper, i.e., queries, human assessments, and extracted features, are available for download.},

	abstract     = {The helpdesk department of Hostnet, a web hosting company, daily receives 35 up to 50 questions from its customers. Within the domain in which Hostnet operates, only few off-the-shelf manuals exist and this is particularly noticeable on the helpdesk. Currently, only a few possibilities for knowledge management and/or elicitation exist within the organization. Questions are answered and problems are solved mostly by relying on the expertise of the staff. They therefore need to have up-to-date knowledge of a variety of possible questions, problem situations and solutions. They also need to be creative and flexible when handling novel questions. Hostnet uses a ticketing system to handle questions from their customers. One of many advantages of using such a system is that all questions are stored, along with their corresponding answers. Hostnet uses the system for some time now and it has thus collected a large amount of domain and organization specific knowledge. This kind of information is exactly the type on which the research area of case-based reasoning focuses. Case-based reasoning uses previously solved problems (cases) as a knowledge source to aid solving similar cases in the future. One of the main components, in any case-based reasoning system, is the retrieval module. This module searches for alike cases, given a new case and a similarity measure. Techniques from the area of Information Retrieval may be used to assist in finding these alike questions, for example by implementing vector-space based, statistical methods. This research focuses on analyzing to what extent previously solved cases can serve as a basis for a statistical information retrieval module of a case-based reasoning system within Hostnet by measuring the effects of different information retrieval techniques on the results. The evaluated techniques are stemming, term weighting and combinations thereof. The above described organizational setting is not unique to Hostnet. Every service-providing company with direct customer contacts is probably familiar with the described situation and could benefit from the presented results. The suggested approach yields adequate results by which, at best, 60\% of new questions can be answered, based on the first 10 retrieved stored questions. The mean reciprocal rank of the first matching question provided room for improvement however, with a value of 7 out of 10. The most important conclusion is that the best results are achieved when applying none of the before mentioned information retrieval techniques. The suggested approach needs to be improved for a successful integration within a case-based reasoning system, but it does seem viable.},
